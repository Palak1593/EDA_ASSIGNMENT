Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of examining and summarizing a dataset to understand its characteristics, identify patterns, and make informed decisions. It involves calculating summary statistics, visualizing data through plots and charts, identifying missing or inconsistent data, and exploring relationships between variables. EDA provides insights that guide further analysis and decision-making.
